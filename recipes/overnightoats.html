    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Oats</li>
        <li>Almond Milk</li>
        <li>Dates</li>
        <li>Cinnamon</li>
        <li>Walnuts</li>
        <li>2 Apples</li>
        <li>25g of Protein Powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place 4 plastic containers out. Pour oatmeal into each container. Perhaps filling
            just under half of each container with oats. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Chop up 8 dates into the smallest pieces possible for each container. Spread into the oats.
        </li>
        <li>
            Crush walnuts into very small pieces as well. Even to the point where they become powder-like.
            Spread a decent amount over each container. 
        </li>
        <li>Chop up 2 apples, once again, into as small as possible pieces. </li>
        <li>Spread a half of each diced apple into each container</li>
        <li>Use a blender to mix 4 servings of protein with almond milk. So 100g's of protein all up.
        </li>
        <li>Pour an even amount of protein shake into each container. You may need to use a spoon to mix the oats
            with the milk.
        </li>
        <li>Once mixed, you'll probably find you have some left over protein shake. But after mixing,
            you'll also find more room to pour. Keep pouring and mixing until you have used up all
            of your protein shake.
        </li>
        <li>Pour a decent amount of cinnamon on top of each container</li>
        <li>Close each lid and place into the fridge overnight</li>
        <li>Enjoy ready made breakfast meals for the next 4 days!</li>
    </ol>
